#   -n 4 - Choose 4 words
#   --random-source=/dev/urandom - Use /dev/urandom as the source of entropy.
#                                   Whatever we choose, it should be non-blocking
#                                   and cryptographically secure. /dev/urandom
#                                   fulfills these requirements on both platforms.
#   /usr/share/dict/words - The dictionary, that should exist on both platforms.
