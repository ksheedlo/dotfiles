# Since this is an important password generating program, here's a breakdown.
#
#   --random-source=/dev/urandom - Use /dev/urandom as the source of entropy.
#                                   Whatever we choose, it should be non-blocking
#                                   and cryptographically secure. /dev/urandom
#                                   fulfills these requirements on both platforms.
#   /usr/share/dict/words - The dictionary, that should exist on both platforms.
#   | grep -v "'" - Some dictionaries include English possessives (e.g.,
#                   "Alice's", "Bob's"). These mess with xargs and are not
#                   particularly useful in passwords anyway as opposed to the
#                   root word of the phrase.
#   | head -n 4 - Choose 4 words. shuf or gshuf has a -n option as well, but
#                 this needs to occur after the grep.
#   | xargs echo - Print everything on one line.
#
